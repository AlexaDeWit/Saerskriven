# The Saerskriven YAML format

Saerskriven's own file format, version 1. Everything the internal model holds has
a place in the file and everything the file holds has a place in the model,
apart from the assumption element links and the assumption model link
[Reading](#reading) describes, so reading a file and writing it back changes
nothing else and neither direction reports a divergence for anything else.
The other format Saerskriven reads, Threat Dragon v2 JSON, is somebody else's
shape and does not have that property.

The format is declared by `@saerskriven/wire-saerskriven-yaml`, a package of one
zod schema that imports nothing but zod. That is the format's definition, and
this page describes it rather than restating it. The codec is
`readSaerskrivenYaml` and `writeSaerskrivenYaml` in `@saerskriven/formats`, paired as
`saerskrivenYamlCodec`, and it is the only place that knows both the file and
the model.

## The file

YAML, UTF-8, one document, a mapping at the root with seven keys in this
order:

| Key                      | What it holds                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `formatVersion`          | `1`, exactly                                                       |
| `metadata`               | Title, owner, description, contributors                            |
| `assumptions`            | What the analysis rests on, linked to threats by id, no model link |
| `diagrams`               | The diagrams, each owning its elements and their geometry          |
| `mitigations`            | Mitigating work, addressing threats by id                          |
| `threats`                | The threats, each attached to elements by id                       |
| `lastIssuedThreatNumber` | The highest threat number ever issued, counting removed ones       |

Every key the first release declared is required and every list may be
empty. Nothing is defaulted: a model saves before it is drawn, and it does so
with empty strings and empty lists rather than with absent keys. Keys added by later releases are optional on read. These include a flow's `bidirectional`, absent
where the read takes the flow as one way, and an attached endpoint's `side`,
one of `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`, which pins the end to that side
of its element and absent leaves the side to the renderer. What a key added
later costs the format is under `formatVersion` below.

That order is three tiers, so a key added to the format later has an obvious
home rather than an argued one. The header comes first, `formatVersion` and
then `metadata`, because it says what the file is and what it covers. The
content follows in alphabetical order, since no other order among
`assumptions`, `diagrams`, `mitigations` and `threats` is more true than the
rest. The bookkeeping the editor keeps for itself goes last, where it is out
of the way of a reader.

An element and a threat category are tagged unions, written with the tag
first: `kind` for an element, a flow endpoint and a boundary shape,
`methodology` for a category.

## `formatVersion`

The version carries the compatibility contract set out below, and it is also what
tells a Saerskriven file apart from a JSON format without consulting the file
extension.

- **Missing**: the read fails, with the issue at path `formatVersion`.
- **A version this release does not know**: the read fails, with the issue at
  path `formatVersion`, and the file is refused whole rather than read in
  part.

A change to the format is additive when the absence of what it adds means
something. A new key is then optional on read, the mapping in
`@saerskriven/formats` supplies what its absence means, a write states it
wherever the model holds a value for it, and `formatVersion` stays where it
is. A write states `bidirectional` on every flow and `side` on every pinned
end. Optional security facts and declared relationships follow the same additive
contract, with absence meaning unknown.

A new value in an enumerated vocabulary is additive too: the version stays
where it is, and every file that does not use the value reads and writes as
it did. An older release refuses a file that holds the new value, at the path
of that value, because its schema does not declare it. An assumption's
`unconfirmed` status arrived this way in version 1.

Everything else is breaking: a rename, a type change, a removal, or a new key
whose absence means nothing. That takes a new `formatVersion`, and a new
version arrives as a wire package of its own beside the one before it, so
`@saerskriven/wire-saerskriven-yaml` goes on declaring version 1 unchanged and
a file of that version keeps the reading it has. The migration from one
version to the next lives in `@saerskriven/formats`, which the layer matrix
makes the only place allowed to know two wire packages. A write emits the
version this release is current on.

Every released version reads, for good. A read dispatches on the version the
file states and chains the migrations from there to the current one, so a
file Saerskriven has ever written opens in every later release of it.
Version 2 is declared by `@saerskriven/wire-saerskriven-yaml-v2`, but nothing
reads it yet, so there is no dispatch and no migration to read: this says what
the first bump has to build.

The internal model cannot change this. The wire schema declares its own ids,
its own vocabularies, and its own record shapes, and the layer matrix forbids
it from reusing the model's, so a model changed for the sake of the editor
leaves version 1 alone. What the two have in common today they have by
coincidence, and the mapping between them is written out in
`@saerskriven/formats`, member by member, so a change on either side stops
compiling there rather than silently reaching a file. A change to what
version 1 carries is a change to the wire schema, deliberately.

## Reading

A key this release does not declare is not a refusal. The read drops it and
reports it as an `undeclared` divergence naming its path, so a file written
by a later release of version 1 still reads here, minus what this release has
no home for. Older releases can open extended v1 files but lose these new
fields when saving. Use a release that understands the fields for lossless edits.
A value this release does not declare in an enumerated vocabulary is a
refusal, at the path of that value, as the additive rule above sets out.

An assumption links threats and nothing else, so its `elements` list has no
place in the model. The read drops every id in it and reports each assumption
whose list held any as a `narrowed` divergence naming that assumption. A
write states `elements: []` on every assumption, so a file this release
writes is still a version 1 file an older release reads.

An assumption in the model may apply to the model as a whole as well as to
threats, and version 1 has no key for that model link. The read never sets
it: every assumption reads without a model link, and one whose `threats` list
is empty reads as it is, with no reference and no divergence. A write of an
assumption that applies to the model writes its threat links, `threats: []`
where it has none, and reports the model link it could not write as a
`narrowed` divergence naming that assumption.

A mitigation is a record, so a threat's `mitigation` text has no place in the
model. The read makes one mitigation record of a non-empty text, linked to
that threat alone, with an empty title, the text as its prose, and the status
`implemented` where the threat is `mitigated` and `proposed` otherwise. Its id
is `<threat id>-mitigation`, counted on with `-2`, `-3` past any id the file
already holds, and the records follow the file's own mitigations in threat
number order, which is the rule the Threat Dragon read follows too. An empty
text makes no record, and the read reports nothing, since nothing is lost. A
write states `mitigation: ""` on every threat, so a file this release writes
is still a version 1 file an older release reads, with its mitigations held
as records.

What a read does refuse, it refuses with a path: into the file where the
schema is what said no, and into the model where a rule no schema states did,
such as a threat referring to an element no diagram holds.

## Security facts

These optional fields use the same names in native YAML, the internal model,
and Threat Dragon's element `data` object.

| Element kind     | Fields                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `actor`          | `providesAuthentication`                                                             |
| `process`        | `handlesCardPayment`, `handlesGoodsOrServices`, `isWebApplication`, `privilegeLevel` |
| `store`          | `isALog`, `isEncrypted`, `isSigned`, `storesCredentials`, `storesInventory`          |
| `flow`           | `protocol`, `isEncrypted`, `isPublicNetwork`, `trustBoundaryIds`                     |
| `trust-boundary` | `containedElements`, `crossingFlows`                                                 |

The flags are booleans. An absent flag means unknown, and `false` records an
explicit negative. `protocol` and `privilegeLevel` are text, without a closed
vocabulary. An empty string is an explicit value and remains distinct from absence.

`trustBoundaryIds` records the boundaries a flow crosses. `containedElements`
records the elements inside a boundary, and `crossingFlows` records its crossing
flows. List order and repeated entries survive conversion. An absent list means
unrecorded relationships. An empty list explicitly records none. The model does
not infer these assertions from geometry or add reciprocal assertions.

Each reference must resolve inside its element's diagram. `trustBoundaryIds`
targets trust boundaries, `crossingFlows` targets flows, and `containedElements`
targets another element. Invalid relationships refuse the read with a field path.

Deleting an element also removes its entries from these lists. A previously
present list can become empty, while an absent list stays absent. Moving, resizing,
renaming, reconnecting or changing flow direction leaves all recorded facts intact.
Copying a selection restricts the copied relationship lists to copied targets,
matching threat links. Pasting remaps every retained target ID.
The original model retains its full lists.

In Studio, select an element and expand **Security properties** to view or edit
these values. The controls distinguish **Not recorded**, explicit flags and
recorded empty values. Every committed edit supports undo and redo.

## Ordering

The bytes are fixed by the model, not by the run: two writes of one model
produce the same file, so a diff shows the edit and nothing else.

- **Keys** are written in the order the wire schema declares them, whatever
  order the model records were built in, with the tag of a tagged union
  first.
- **Threats** are written in number order. A threat number is unique across
  the model and is never reissued, so ordering by it is total and it holds
  each threat's position in the file steady as the model is edited.
- **Diagrams, elements, mitigations and assumptions** keep the order the
  model holds them in. Diagrams and elements are drawn in that order, so it
  is information rather than incidental. Mitigations and assumptions have
  nothing to sort on that would order them any better: their ids are
  generated, so sorting by id scatters them and drops each new record
  wherever its id falls, and a title moves when a record is retitled.
- **No line is wrapped.** A long description is one long line, so editing a
  sentence changes the line it is on rather than reflowing the paragraph
  under it.

A read preserves the order the file states. It is a write that orders, so a
hand-edited file reaches canonical order the next time Saerskriven saves it.

## An example

Written by the codec, and compared against it by a test, so it is what a save
produces rather than a rendering of one. The formatter is told to leave it
alone for that reason.

Two production-scale examples are committed.
[`threat-modelling/saerskriven.yaml`](../threat-modelling/README.md) is Saerskriven's
own threat model, the file to read first, because it was authored in this
format rather than converted into it. `test-data/saerskriven/ecluse.yaml` is the
Écluse threat model, read from its Threat Dragon file and written here, which
is what a conversion into this format looks like.
