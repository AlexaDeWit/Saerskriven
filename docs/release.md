# Cutting a release

The procedure for shipping a version of Saerskriven: what the version number is,
who moves it, and what turns it into downloadable executables and the website.
How the executables are built and reproduced is in [Building the
executables](build.md).

## What decides the version

One number for the whole workspace. The root [`package.json`](../package.json)
carries it, every project's manifest carries the same one, and the CLI build
stamps it into the executable, so `saer --version` and the tag cannot
disagree.

`nx release` writes that number. It reads the [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) subjects on `main` since the
last `v*` tag and derives the bump from them. Merges are squashed with the
pull request's title as the subject, so **PR titles decide version bumps**: a
`fix:` title is a patch, `feat:` a minor, and a `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
footer a major. While the workspace is on a `0.x` line nx shifts each of those
down one step, so a breaking change moves the minor and a feature the patch.

## Why a person runs most of it

The repository's rulesets set the shape:

- **Tag Integrity** requires a signature on every tag and forbids deleting,
  updating or force-moving one. Its bypass list is empty, so no workflow token
  can create a tag here and no tag can be corrected after the fact.
- **Tag Creation** restricts who may create a tag and names the admin role as
  its bypass, because the owner has to be able to cut one. It is a separate
  ruleset because a bypass in one ruleset does not bypass another, so Tag
  Integrity's empty list keeps standing over the same tags. The bypass names a
  role because the rulesets API has no `User` actor type. Role id 5 is admin,
  which here is the owner.
- **PR Only** admits nothing to `main` except through a pull request, and its
  bypass list is empty too, so no workflow can push the version commit.
  **Main Integrity**, also with an empty bypass list, forbids deleting `main`
  or rewriting its history.
- **Signed Commits**, **PR Status Checks** and **Pull Requests Review** carry
  the rest of the requirements on `main`. Each of those three names the admin
  role as a bypass actor, so they are the maintainer's discipline, while Tag
  Integrity, PR Only and Main Integrity are what no one can pass.

So `nx release` writes files and touches git not at all
([`nx.json`](../nx.json), `release`), the owner lands them like any change, and
the owner signs the tag. Publication starts after the tag exists.

## The procedure

Pull requests rehearse the release through artifact creation and attestation.
The same jobs run on ordinary main, tag, and manual CI runs:

- Build and test the host CLI, then compile all five targets twice and compare
  their bytes. Package `install.sh` with the release tag and every binary's
  SHA-256 embedded. Check the host version and every executable and installer
  checksum.
- Build the studio archive and metadata from the workspace version. A tag run
  additionally requires that version to match its tag.
- Generate attestations for the executables, installer, checksums, website
  archive, and metadata. Verify each against this repository, workflow, source
  ref, and commit.
- Require those stages in `CI gate` before publication can run.

Native Linux and macOS smoke jobs use the packaged installer with the system
Bash and tools, without Nix or Node. They replace the download transport with
local release assets, run the installed CLI, repeat the install, and confirm
that a corrupted download leaves the installed version unchanged.

Fork and Dependabot PRs still build and validate the artifacts. GitHub gives
them read-only tokens, so they cannot generate attestations. The gate accepts
an attestation skip only for those runs. A failed or unexpected skipped stage
fails the gate. Attestation jobs install no dependencies and execute no
artifact.

PR artifacts remain in the workflow run for seven days. PRs create neither a
GitHub release nor a production Pages deployment.

### 1. Write the version and the changelog (owner, no credentials)

On a branch cut from an up-to-date `main`:

```sh
git switch -c release-v<version>
RELEASE_VERSION=v<version> DRY_RUN=1 nix develop --command pnpm nx run release-tools:prepare
RELEASE_VERSION=v<version> nix develop --command pnpm nx run release-tools:prepare
```

The dry run shows the bump Nx derives from the commit history. The full run
writes that version into every manifest, refreshes `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and writes
the changelog. It then formats the generated changelog and checks the whole
tree's formatting. Read both diffs: the changelog is what users will see on the
release page. Then run `pnpm check`, as for any change.

### 2. Land it on main (owner, no credentials)

Open a pull request in the usual way and merge it once the gate is green. Give
it a `chore(release): v<version>` title: it is the squash subject, and a
`chore` subject asks for no further bump.

### 3. Rehearse the guarded release (owner, GitHub CLI)

On the merge commit, before the tag exists:

```sh
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
RELEASE_VERSION=v<version> DRY_RUN=1 nix develop --command pnpm nx run release-tools:tag
```

The script refuses unless every manifest carries the stated version, the tree
is clean, `HEAD` is `origin/main`, and the latest `CI gate` check passed on that
commit. It does not require a Codecov commit status, since Codecov uploads are
advisory on main, tag and manual runs. It also requires Tag Integrity to hold
its full rule set with an empty bypass list, so restore any temporary recovery
bypass before this check. The tool refuses if the tag exists locally or on the
remote. It then runs the dependency provenance check and prints the commit it
cleared. The dry run creates and pushes nothing.

The provenance check reads the catalog's resolved versions out of
`pnpm-lock.yaml`, verifies each package's npm provenance attestation against the
sigstore trust root, and reads the source repository out of what verifies. Its
baseline is the same catalog read out of `HEAD^`'s lockfile (`--base <ref>`
compares against another commit). It audits on both sides the packages whose
version moved, and fails where one that carried an attestation on the base
commit no longer does, where the attestation now names a different repository,
where a signature or an attestation does not verify, and where a package
carries no registry signature though the registry publishes signing keys. The
packages that publish no attestation at all are printed as the residual, which
is what a release accepts and what Saerskriven's own threat model names.

A move that is a real change of home is accepted in the body of the commit that
makes it, as a trailer, one line per package:

```text
Provenance-Move: <name> <old-repository> <new-repository>
```

The check reads it out of the commits between the base and the head, wherever a
squash merge left it, and it admits the move it names and no other.

The CI gate runs the same check on a tag, on every push to main, and on a pull
request whenever `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` changed. This step
runs it whatever the commit's own diff touched, so a tag that cannot be moved
is never cut on an unanswered question. Run it in an installed checkout: it
parses both lockfiles with the catalog's `yaml`. Exit code 2 says the check
could not run rather than that provenance failed, and names why. Only an
unreachable registry is worth running again. Every other cause names what to
correct.

### 4. Cut and push the signed tag (owner, GPG key and GitHub CLI)

Run the same tool without `DRY_RUN`:

```sh
RELEASE_VERSION=v<version> nix develop --command pnpm nx run release-tools:tag
```

The tool repeats every check, creates the signed tag on the cleared commit,
verifies its signature, and asks you to type the tag before it pushes. It
removes the local tag if any later check or the confirmation fails. The pushed
tag cannot be moved or deleted.

### 5. Build, attest, publish, and deploy (automatic)

Pushing the tag runs [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
It runs the same CI gate as a pull request, compiles every CLI target as
`saer-<version>-<target>`, and checks the executable version against the tag.
The installer places the binary at `saer` and adds `saerskriven -> saer` for
compatibility.

After source checks pass, `pages-build` builds the website from that exact tag.
It takes the Pages base path and site URL from GitHub, so project sites and
custom domains receive matching asset URLs, and the same value sets the
canonical URL, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`. Those always name the https
site, because GitHub reports a custom domain as http until HTTPS is enforced. It stamps the workspace version
into the browser bundle and `version.json`. It compares every project manifest
and the built version with the tag before creating `studio.tar` and
`studio-release.json`. The latter records the source commit and CI run.

`attest` waits for the source checks and website build. It attests the CLI
executables, `install.sh`, `SHA256SUMS`, and both website assets, then verifies
every asset against the source ref and commit. `CI gate` requires that
verification. `publish` waits for the gate and creates or updates the release
with those files. A failed gate, website build, or attestation prevents
publication. Neither attest nor publish installs dependencies.

A tag containing a prerelease suffix creates a prerelease, which cannot reach
production Pages. Release notes use the changelog section, or GitHub's generated
notes when the section is missing. Both paths append the installation commands
in [`scripts/release/install-notes.md`](../scripts/release/install-notes.md),
pinned to this tag. Publication retries refresh those notes along with the
assets.

#### Website promotion and recovery

After publication, `pages-prepare` and `pages-deploy` run in the same
workflow. Automatic deployment uses that run's tag and archive, and only while
that release is GitHub's Latest stable release: a release another has
superseded skips deployment. There is no separate Pages workflow or
cross-workflow dispatch, and `main` is never built for deployment.

Promotion verifies both website assets' attestations against this repository,
`ci.yml`, the release tag, and its exact source commit. It checks the source
run's tag-push identity and its latest completed gate, website-build,
attestation, and publication jobs. It does not wait for the whole run, which
includes this deployment, so a failed deployment can retry after the release
stages succeeded. Preparation holds read permissions. Deployment holds
`pages: write` and `id-token: write`, without installing dependencies.

The `github-pages` concurrency group serializes deployments. The deployment
job rechecks Latest after any queue or environment approval wait, so an older
run cannot overwrite a newer deployment. GitHub can replace a pending job when
another enters the group, so retry a cancelled deployment as described below.
The previous website remains visible during promotion or after failure.

For the first release, select **GitHub Actions** as the Pages source, set
the intended custom domain, and enable **Enforce HTTPS** before tagging.
Without it the http address serves a duplicate of the site instead of
redirecting. The `github-pages` environment must
allow `v*` tags for automatic releases and `main` for manual retries. The
separate `release` environment remains restricted to tags. Check the Pages
policy with:

```sh
gh api repos/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/environments/github-pages/deployment-branch-policies
```

Cut a new release containing these workflows through the guarded procedure
above. A pre-existing release without website assets, a draft or a prerelease
cannot bootstrap a production site. After the first deployment, submit the
sitemap URL to search engines. A project site cannot control the host-root
`robots.txt` on the shared `github.io` domain, so the generated one governs
crawlers only on a custom domain.

If Pages fails after publication, rerun its failed jobs while the staged
artifact exists, or dispatch CI from `main` with the deployment-only option:

```sh
gh workflow run ci.yml --repo AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven --ref main -f deploy_pages=true
```

This mode skips the build, check, and publication jobs. Its skipped gate uses
a different check name to preserve the last CI verdict on `main`. It resolves
Latest again and reuses that release's attested assets, including after the
temporary Actions artifacts expire. Missing assets or a failed attestation stop
promotion. A code fix or a changed Pages domain or base path requires a new
release, because promotion keeps the archived website unchanged. Do not
substitute a build from current `main`.

After deployment, a bounded check requests `version.json` with cache bypass
parameters and compares it with the promoted tag. A stale response keeps the
run failed until a retry sees the expected version. Verify the version in the
Project menu in a fresh browser load too. Existing tabs retain their loaded
version and unsaved work. The studio neither relabels an older bundle from the
release API nor forces an editor reload.

### 6. Check what shipped (owner)

Download `install.sh` from the release page and follow the
[installation instructions](../README.md#macos-and-linux), including installer
attestation verification before execution. Run it with `--verify-attestation`,
then run `saer --version` and compare with the release tag.
The installer must also appear in `SHA256SUMS`. For a manual executable check:

```sh
gh attestation verify saer-* --repo AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven \
  --signer-workflow AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/.github/workflows/ci.yml \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/v<version>"
```

The source ref excludes PR and main attestations. Add `--source-digest` with
the signed tag's commit to require that commit too. The [README's install
section](../README.md#install) is the instruction a user follows, so following
it is the test of it. [Rebuilding a released
executable](build.md#rebuilding-a-released-executable) checks the bytes.

### 7. Update the Nix package (owner, GitHub CLI)

Run the [Nix release updater](nix.md#updating-the-release-pin) after the
release assets and attestations exist. It computes the hashes and writes
`nix/release.json`. Review that change and its package checks in a separate
PR. The signed release tag stays unchanged, and its gate continues to check the
previously published package.

## What the rules guarantee, and what they cannot

GitHub has no single switch that forbids a release from outside CI, so the
guarantee is assembled from rules that are each verifiable: the rulesets
[above](#why-a-person-runs-most-of-it), and these.

- The **`release` environment**, which `ci.yml`'s publish job names, admits
  `v*` tags and nothing else. The jobs already test the ref and the event, and
  the policy is what still holds if a later edit to those conditions is wrong.
  No required reviewer is set, so a green gate publishes without a human click.
- Every asset carries a **build provenance attestation** from the `attest`
  job, which needs no repository setting and which a stranger can check. The
  [README's install section](../README.md#install) has the commands and the
  verification limits.

### Checking the configuration has not drifted

Each command is followed by what it prints with the settings applied.

```sh
for id in $(gh api repos/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/rulesets \
              --jq '.[] | select(.target == "tag") | .id'); do
  gh api "repos/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/rulesets/$id" \
    --jq '{name, rules: [.rules[].type], bypass_actors}'
done
```

```
{"bypass_actors":[{"actor_id":5,"actor_type":"RepositoryRole","bypass_mode":"always"}],"name":"Tag Creation","rules":["creation"]}
{"bypass_actors":[],"name":"Tag Integrity","rules":["deletion","non_fast_forward","update","required_signatures"]}
```

Tag Integrity's empty bypass is the part to watch: a bypass actor there, or a
`creation` rule, would mean the two rulesets had been folded together.

```sh
gh api repos/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/environments/release \
  --jq '{name, protection_rules: [.protection_rules[].type],
         deployment_branch_policy}'
gh api \
  repos/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/environments/release/deployment-branch-policies \
  --jq '[.branch_policies[] | {id, name, type}]'
```

```
{"deployment_branch_policy":{"custom_branch_policies":true,"protected_branches":false},"name":"release","protection_rules":["branch_policy"]}
[{"id":59133693,"name":"v*","type":"tag"}]
```

`protection_rules` holding `branch_policy` alone says no reviewer is required.
A `required_reviewers` entry would appear there.

```sh
gh api repos/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/actions/permissions/workflow \
  --jq '{default_workflow_permissions, can_approve_pull_request_reviews}'
```

```
{"can_approve_pull_request_reviews":false,"default_workflow_permissions":"read"}
```

A workflow token starts read-only. `publish` adds release writes. `attest`
adds attestation and OIDC writes. `pages-deploy` adds Pages and OIDC writes.
Build jobs receive neither release nor Pages deployment permissions.

### What none of this can do

A collaborator with write access can still create a release object through the
API and attach anything to it. No GitHub rule prevents that. What the rules
give is narrower: write access is the owner's alone and tag creation with it,
a release from this pipeline exists only where the gate was green on a tag the
owner signed and pushed, and every genuine asset is attested, so anyone can
tell an imposter apart.

`ci.yml` accepts `workflow_dispatch`. Publication still requires
`github.event_name == 'push'` and a tag ref. An ordinary dispatch runs checks
without publishing. The `deploy_pages` option runs only deployment and only
from `main`, using an existing attested stable release.

Immutable releases are not available on this plan, so assets can still be
replaced after a release is published and `upload --clobber` keeps working.
The attestation does not depend on any of these settings, which is why the
README teaches it rather than the checksum alone.

## When something goes wrong

- **The workflow failed after the tag was pushed.** Re-run it from the Actions
  tab. The publish step is idempotent: where a release for the tag already
  exists it replaces that release's assets rather than failing, so a run that
  died partway through leaves nothing to clean up by hand. The re-run checks
  out the same tag, so a fix that has to reach the built code needs a new
  version.
- **The tag names a version the manifests do not carry.** The version check in
  `build-test` fails, which fails the gate, so the publish job never runs. Cut
  a new version.
- **A target stops cross-compiling.** Run
  `pnpm nx compile @saerskriven/cli --configuration=all` on Linux inside
  `nix develop` ([Building the executables](build.md)).
- **A dependency lost its provenance attestation, or moved to another source
  repository.** The `provenance` job fails and with it the gate, so nothing is
  published. Read what the check printed: either the move is one this project
  takes, and a `Provenance-Move:` trailer on the commit that makes it accepts
  it, or the registry is answering wrongly and the release waits.
- **An external service failed the run.** A semgrep scan that cannot fetch its
  rules or a provenance check that cannot reach the npm registry blocks
  publication. Re-run from the Actions tab once the service is back.
