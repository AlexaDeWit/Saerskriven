# threat-modelling

Saerskriven's own threat model, in Saerskriven's own format.

## `saerskriven.yaml`

Two diagrams. `read-and-render` is the path a model file takes from disk
through the codecs into a register or a diagram. `agent-and-desktop` is the
path an agent or the desktop shell takes to the same core. Between them, 37
elements and 4 trust boundaries, 25 threats, 37 mitigations and 3
assumptions.
The threats are the ones this repository actually has: hostile files reaching
the read limits and the wire schemas, foreign prose reaching the render
paths, the desktop IPC bridge, and the MCP write tools.

Every status is true to the tree. A threat is mitigated where a mechanism is
on `main` and a mitigation record names that mechanism, open where the
surface is designed and its issue is named but nothing is built, and carries
an undecided severity where there is nothing built to assess. A third case
sits between the first two. A threat is partly held where a mechanism is on
`main` and does not cover the whole surface: it stays open, and its mitigation
record names the mechanism and what the mechanism leaves behind rather than an
issue. Threat 25 is the one of those. Fifteen are mitigated, nine are open,
and one is transferred to whoever publishes a register. Every mitigated
threat names a mitigation record, and every open one names either the issue
that carries the work or, where it is partly held, the mechanism and its
residual.

It is a draft the maintainer will refine. What it is not is decoration: it is
the second production-scale fixture the suites gate on, beside the Écluse
model under `test-data/`, and the first one authored in the native format
rather than read out of Threat Dragon's.

## Where it gates

| Suite              | What it holds the file to                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/formats` | It reads with no divergence, it is its own golden, and it is opened as Saerskriven YAML without being told |
| `packages/formats` | No read bound refuses it, alongside the Écluse file and the Threat Dragon corpus                           |
| `packages/render`  | `test-data/render/saerskriven.register.snapshot.md` is its threat register                                 |
| `packages/render`  | One standalone SVG document per diagram, under `test-data/render/`                                         |
| `packages/canvas`  | One committed scene per diagram, beside `scene.spec.tsx`                                                   |
| `apps/cli`         | `validate` counts its diagrams, elements and threats, and `render` draws a diagram named by id or title    |
| `apps/studio`      | It opens in the browser and saves back as the format it arrived in                                         |

The formats, render and canvas suites read lists rather than paths, so a
third model file joins every one of them by being added to `nativeFixtures`
in `packages/formats/src/lib/saerskriven-yaml.fixtures.ts`, and to the register,
document and scene lists in the render and canvas specs. Each diagram is
drawn twice on purpose: the canvas golden is the glyphs alone, and the render
golden is the SVG document composed around them. The two app suites name the
path.

This file is its own golden, so `packages/formats` writes it back where it
differs during an explicit snapshot update. Normal tests read the committed
bytes. The render and canvas suites read the derived model through
`test-data/saerskriven.model.json`, so the layer matrix needs no dependency on
the formats package.

`packages/formats` also writes this model out as
`test-data/saerskriven.model.json`, because the render and canvas suites gate on
a model and the layer matrix keeps the codec out of their reach. Where that
goes is a field on the same `nativeFixtures` entry, so a third file brings
its own. Écluse names none: `test-data/ecluse.model.json` is written by
`packages/model` from its own hand transcription of the Threat Dragon file,
the fixture that carries M1's representability gate, and this suite compares
its read against that file rather than producing it. A file authored in the
native format has no such transcription, so the codec is its only producer.

That file is derived. This one is the source.

## Editing it

The committed bytes are what `writeSaerskrivenYaml` produces, compared as a
vitest file snapshot against the file itself. A hand edit that leaves the
writer's canonical form therefore reds the suite rather than passing. Edit the
file, then regenerate it in the same commit:

```sh
pnpm snapshots:update @saerskriven/formats  # YAML and model JSON
pnpm snapshots:update @saerskriven/render   # register and SVG
pnpm snapshots:update @saerskriven/canvas   # canvas SVG
```

Read every diff before committing. Each of those files is an output by
definition, so a change to one is a change to what the format, the register,
or the canvas writes.

Each test target that reads this directory names it in a fixture input, so an
edit invalidates its cached result. `.oxfmtrc.json`
leaves the YAML here alone, for the same reason it leaves the payloads under
`test-data/` alone: a formatter must not rewrite a file that is compared byte
for byte.

## One thing the drawing gets wrong

The name of `tb-untrusted`, the curve trust boundary on `agent-and-desktop`,
is drawn across the curve rather than beside it. That is not this file's
geometry. `packages/canvas` places a curve boundary's name centred one line
above the middle waypoint, which for a divider running down the page is a
point on the curve itself, and no arrangement of waypoints moves it off.
Leave the waypoints alone; the fix belongs in the canvas.

A flow's name is different, and is this file's to place. It is drawn beside
the midpoint of the flow's longest segment, so a flow crossing a boundary
puts its name near that crossing, and a gap narrower than the name means a
dashed edge drawn through it. Every gap here is wide enough for the name that
crosses it with room to spare, measured against the name unwrapped rather
than as the canvas happens to wrap it today. Moving an element toward a
boundary is what breaks that, so re-render and look after any move.
