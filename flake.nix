          # graph is what puts the file there (nix/resvg-wasm/project.json

          # consumer targets because it has to be absolute: nx strips
          # `{workspaceRoot}` out of an option value instead of expanding it,
          # so a target can only state a workspace-relative path, and most of
          # the consumer tasks run with their own project root as the working
          # directory. The CLI's build settles it either way: its executor is
          # not run-commands, which is the only kind nx passes an option's
          # environment to. The root is walked up to rather than read from
          # $PWD, so entering the shell in a subdirectory still names the one
          # path.

          # development server allows that root and no longer names the
