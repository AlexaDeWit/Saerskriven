# The studio's browser suite

Browser tests cover layout, focus, pointer and touch gestures, file input,
downloads, and accessibility. Use unit tests for behaviour that does not need
a browser.

## Running the suite

Run inside `nix develop`:

```sh
pnpm nx e2e @saerskriven/studio-e2e
```

Browsers come from the flake. `src/version-pairing.spec.ts` checks that the
catalog's `@playwright/test` version matches the flake's driver.

`playwright.config.ts` starts the development server and a Pages preview.
The projects run in order:

- `chromium` runs the main browser specs.
- `phone` re-runs the chrome-card, notices and records specs on a `Pixel 7`
  preset, the viewport the shell chrome and the threat panel have least room
  in. `chromium` runs the same specs at desktop width.
- `pages` checks the production build below `/Saerskriven/`, including PDF
  assets, the social card, its text alternative, and the release version.
- `frame-time` measures an Écluse drag with one worker and one retry. Earlier
  project failures skip it. Other browser work must not compete with this measurement.

The Pages build uses a separate Vite cache to avoid reloading the development
page during tests. Its output and the Playwright reports stay under this
project's ignored `test-output/` directory.

## Waiting on the canvas

Wait for `canvasSettled` from `src/studio.fixtures.ts` before sending a canvas
gesture. Opening a model fits its diagram after React Flow measures the
canvas. A click sent during that fit can land at the wrong position.
The fixture polls the viewport transform until consecutive readings match.

## The round-trip coverage matrix

The studio requirements from [M4](https://github.com/AlexaDeWit/Saerskriven/milestone/5)
map to the browser specs below. Paths are relative to `src/`.

`tests/` holds unit specs for shared browser helpers: shortcut chords against
the command registry, and the path comparison used by the round-trip test.

The browser suite does not check the browser-owned `beforeunload` prompt.
The file-menu unit specs cover its registration. Dedicated boundary deletion
coverage is absent. The canvas package owns detailed glyph and stylesheet
checks. Automated accessibility checks do not replace manual screen-reader
review. The configured browser projects use Chromium only, the phone one
through a device preset rather than another engine.

Current interaction limitations live in the
[canvas documentation](../studio/src/canvas/README.md#what-is-not-attempted-here).
