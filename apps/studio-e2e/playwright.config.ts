    // Playwright skips a project whose dependency failed, so a red anywhere
    // else in the smoke leaves the floor unreported rather than reported
    // green. A burst of activity elsewhere on the host can still land inside
    // the drag, so a single noisy run is retried once and a second failure is
    // the reading. The retry records no trace: tracing paces the drag with
    // screenshots and snapshots, and a retry under more load than the first
    // attempt is no second reading. Both ceilings in the spec are regression
    // signals. The share ceiling does not move. The single-longest-frame
    // ceiling sits above the band a GitHub-hosted runner produces on its own
    // (#309) and moves only with a new reading of that band.
