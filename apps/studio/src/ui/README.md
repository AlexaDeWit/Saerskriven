# Studio UI components

Behaviour comes from [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) headless primitives,
imported from the single `radix-ui` package; nothing here adopts a component
kit. Styling is a CSS module per component, drawing every colour, space and
radius from the design tokens below, with Radix state read through its own
`data-state` and `data-highlighted` attributes rather than through classes a
component would have to keep in step. No CSS-in-JS, no Tailwind, and no second
stylesheet.

## Tokens

The values are the canvas package's
([the visual system](../../../../packages/canvas/README.md#the-visual-system)),
projected as custom properties into the document head by
[`../../initial-page.mts`](../../initial-page.mts). The browser receives that
sheet before the app script, so the loading indicator and the diagram use the
same canvas ground. A blocking script beside the sheet applies a saved Light
or Dark choice before the first paint. [`../theme.tsx`](../theme.tsx) applies
later choices to the document root. A colour written into another stylesheet
is a failing spec, `../theme.spec.tsx`, which walks the production files of
this app and of the canvas package for one.

Every colour token is declared twice, the second time under
`prefers-color-scheme: dark` from the dark table. That is the whole of dark
mode: a control reads the same property either way and no component asks which
mode it is in. The properties below the colours, the type scale, the spacing
and the focus ring, are declared once, being the same in both.

| Token                                                                | What it decides                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `--pn-font-family`, `--pn-font-size`, `--pn-line-height`             | The type scale                     |
| `--pn-colour-surface`, `--pn-colour-surface-raised`                  | What a control sits on             |
| `--pn-colour-canvas`                                                 | What a diagram is drawn on         |
| `--pn-colour-text`, `--pn-colour-text-muted`                         | Text, at WCAG AA on either surface |
| `--pn-colour-border`                                                 | Every hairline                     |
| `--pn-colour-grid`                                                   | The canvas's graph-paper ruling    |
| `--pn-colour-accent`, `--pn-colour-accent-text`                      | Selection and the focus indicator  |
| `--pn-colour-accent-hover`                                           | The primary action under a pointer |
| `--pn-colour-actor`, `--pn-colour-process`                           | The wash inside those two glyphs   |
| `--pn-colour-badge-ground`                                           | What a threat badge is lettered in |
| `--pn-colour-tone-critical` to `--pn-colour-tone-neutral`            | One per severity                   |
| `--pn-space-1` to `--pn-space-4`                                     | Every gap and every pad            |
| `--pn-panel-cover`                                                   | Default threat pane coverage       |
| `--pn-chrome-block-size`                                             | The chrome card's height, measured |
| `--pn-radius`                                                        | Every corner                       |
| `--pn-focus-ring`, `--pn-focus-ring-width`, `--pn-focus-ring-offset` | The one visible focus indicator    |

The two washes, the badge ground and the five tones are the diagram's own
colours rather than the chrome's. The threat summary uses the same tone classes as the canvas. The canvas
stylesheet reads these properties, which is how both follow the mode
([the canvas](../canvas/README.md)). Four rows are read from both sides:
`--pn-colour-surface-raised` is a panel in the chrome and the fill inside
every element outline on the diagram, `--pn-colour-canvas` is the ground and
the halo cut under a flow name, and the two inks letter and draw the diagram
as well as the chrome. Every colour role has a property whether a
control reads it yet or not, so the light and the dark block stay one list.

A control never suppresses the focus indicator and never invents its own: it
applies the focus tokens in `:focus-visible`, swapping the ring's colour only
where the accent is the background it would be drawn on.

## Adding a control

1. Take the primitive from `radix-ui`, and read its options from the model
   rather than retyping them.
2. Add a CSS module beside it, built from the tokens above.
3. Give it a visible `<label>` tied to the primitive's own control element.
4. Keep an overlay inside the control's own element rather than letting the
   primitive send it to the document body, so it sits in whichever landmark
   the panel declares.
5. Add a spec beside it.

## What is here that is not a control

Three components carry no Radix primitive, because none of them takes an
edit. `LiveRegion` is the one way anything here announces. An unnamed use is
an atomic polite status. Its empty host stays mounted before and after each
message, so assistive technology observes later content changes. A transient
edit status ends at the next action that moves canvas or panel state, on the
store's own subscription ([the store](../store/README.md#the-shape)).
Repeated words use a new sequence key and announce again.

A named use holds durable feedback. It cannot go inside a menu, which owns
items and groups only, so the menu's regions stand beside it
([the file bridge](../files/README.md)). `FailureNotice` renders
`StudioFailure` inside one, whatever produced it, so one region shows the
model refusing an edit, a codec refusing a file, and the platform refusing
to hand one over. It words every variant: nothing reaches a person as a tag,
and a codec's paths are kept because they say which line of a file was
refused rather than that the file was. It carries a Dismiss button of its
own, which dispatches `Action.DismissFailure` rather than taking a callback,
so the view mounting it passes the refusal and nothing else. Several paths
fold behind a disclosure naming how many there are, a single one staying
open, so a refusal naming a path per line does not fill a phone screen.
`FailureNotice`, inline field errors, and the loss report stand until the
state they describe resolves or the person dismisses them, never on a timer.
`ErrorBoundary` is the last stop for a throw from anywhere below it, and is
a class because React offers no other way to catch one; it holds the only
component state in this directory for that reason. It needs no live region,
because it replaces the tree it was guarding rather than announcing into it.

## What a composed control owes

The primitive underneath is not the bar; the component here is. Every control
carries a label association, a keyboard path from Tab through commit, and the
role a screen reader expects, and a spec proves all three rather than a person
reading the markup. `jsx-a11y` in `.oxlintrc.json` is the static half of that
and the axe-core run in `apps/studio-e2e` is the runtime half, which audits
the page at rest and every open overlay in its own scope.

A control takes its value as a prop and reports an edit through one commit
callback, so the edit becomes a store action and is undoable. No form library
holds it and no control holds model state of its own. `EnumField` accepts a `labelOf` function when an option stores an ID but shows
a name. Its listbox stays within the available viewport. It is the
worked example, and `SeverityField`, `StatusField` and `CategoryField` are it
three times: each reads its options from a model schema, so the field offers
what the model names and nothing else, and each hands its committed value to
the panel, which dispatches one `Action.ReplaceThreat` that the Undo control
takes back with nothing added ([the panel](../panel/README.md)). A commit that
would not change the value dispatches nothing, because a no-op operation still
returns a new model and so marks the file dirty ([the store's
README](../store/README.md)).

A text field is the one control that holds anything: what is typed is its own
until it is committed, which is what keeps text the model refuses on screen to
be corrected. It commits when it is left rather than as it is typed, so one
edit is one undo step, and it follows the value it is given whenever that
value moves, which is how an undo lands in a field a person is looking at.
Every change to whether the model is refusing what it holds is reported
through a second callback, because a refusal shown in the field alone is a
refusal nothing announces and nothing can keep on screen. The refusal it
shows is the character clause alone, the label above it already naming the
field; the sentence the callback carries names the field, for whatever reads
it away from the control, and the text goes with it. A field can be opened on
a draft reported that way rather than on the value it is given, which is how
the threat panel puts a refused draft back in the field it was typed in after
the panel itself has been unmounted ([the panel](../panel/README.md)).

`ProseField` starts at eight lines, or three when `compact`, which is how the
threat editor's record rows stay short. CSS `field-sizing: content` grows it
with its text up to 24 lines while preserving manual vertical resizing.
Browsers without this CSS property keep the starting height and its resize
control.

The Appearance choice in the File menu selects System, Light, or Dark. System uses the browser media preference. An explicit choice sets `data-pn-colour-mode` on the document root and persists through reload. Components read tokens only, so the mode does not add palette values to component styles.
