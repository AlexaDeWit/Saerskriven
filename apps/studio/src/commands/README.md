# The studio's commands

One home per command. Every command the studio offers is named once, in
`registry.ts`, with the words a person reads, any assigned chord, and the
dispatch it runs. A control does not hold a handler and a key press does not
hold a second copy of one. Both go through the registry, so a button and its
shortcut cannot drift apart.

## What a command is

`registry.ts` is one record, keyed by command id, and every lookup is over
that key rather than a search. Each entry carries:

- **the label**, which is what a menu, a toolbox tooltip or a bare
  `CommandButton` says;
- **the group and context**, which place and explain it in the shortcut
  reference;
- **the shortcuts**, zero or more chords, in the order they are offered;
- **`inTextFields`**, whether the chord still fires while a person is typing;
- **the dispatch**, either a `run` against the `CommandSurface` or `pending`
  naming the issue that will give the command one.

`pending` is a command whose surface has not landed. The chord is registered,
shown and claimed from the browser now, so the shortcut a person learns does
not move when the surface arrives, and the entry flips from `pending` to
`runs` in the issue that builds it. Nothing else about the command changes.

`CommandSurface` is what a command reaches that is not a module-level
function: the file session, which holds the fallback picker only a component
can hold and the question a close asks over unsaved work, and React Flow's
viewport, which lives as long as the canvas is mounted. The
store's own dispatches and the canvas edits need no surface, which is why a
control runs those with nothing mounted above it. The app builds the one
surface, in `app.tsx`, because that is the single place holding both the file
session and the viewport. The viewport half is a hook the canvas exports, so
the fit a command runs and the fit an open runs are one calculation ([the
canvas](../canvas/README.md)).

A completed Undo or Redo command writes its name to the shared edit status.
The command says nothing when its history stack is empty.

Focus threats is a page command on T. It uses the panel's focus channel to
open the selected element's panel when needed and focus "Add a threat". Text
fields and open overlays keep T for their own input.

Model properties is a page command on M, and runs from the Edit group of the
root menu too. It dispatches `ShowModelProperties`, which clears the canvas
selection and shows the model's properties in the panel location with focus in
Title ([the panel](../panel/README.md#the-models-properties)). Where they
already show, it closes them and focuses the canvas, as Escape does. Text
fields and open overlays keep M for their own input, so M typed into Title is
a letter of the title.

## Chords, and how a platform writes them

`shortcuts.ts` holds the chord. A chord is a set of modifiers and one key
from a closed list, so a binding names a key the studio decided on rather
than any string a keyboard can produce, and two commands reaching for one
chord is a comparison over a known alphabet. The registry's spec holds that
no two commands share one. The five export commands have none, as issue #190
permits.

`Mod` is the platform's command modifier: Command on Apple hardware, Control
everywhere else. The platform is read once at load, from the user agent data
where a browser offers it and `navigator.platform` where it does not, and
each chord is then written three ways.

Undo uses Command+Z on macOS and Ctrl+Z on Linux and Windows. Redo uses
Shift+Command+Z on macOS, and Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y on Linux and Windows.
The Ctrl+Y alternative is absent from macOS matching, labels, and ARIA
attributes. Copy, cut, paste, open, save, selection, and view commands use
the same platform modifier. Backspace supports the Delete key on Mac
keyboards. Enter edits selected canvas text without requiring F2.
Zoom accepts either the equals key or the produced plus character. Shifted
number-row commands also match their digit key code when the event reports
punctuation, such as `!` for Shift+1.

| Where                | Apple          | Elsewhere         |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Tooltip, menu, panel | `⇧⌘S`          | `Ctrl+Shift+S`    |
| `aria-keyshortcuts`  | `Shift+Meta+S` | `Control+Shift+S` |

The attribute is spelled as ARIA asks rather than as a person reads it: it is
the one attribute that says which key runs a control, and assistive
technology reads the binding from it. The spelling a person reads is the
tooltip and the control's accessible description, which is what
`CommandButton` renders beside the button rather than inside it: inside, the
accessible name of Save would read "Save Ctrl+S".

A control with no words on it needs more than that, so `IconCommandButton` is
the same control drawn as a glyph. The registry's label becomes the accessible
name, the glyph carrying none, and the label with its chord is a Radix tooltip
rather than the `title` attribute its worded sibling holds: `title` is shown to
a pointer alone, and an icon has to say what it is to a keyboard as well. The
tooltip renders where it stands rather than through a portal, so it stays in
whichever landmark the control sits in, and it leaves with the pointer that
opened it. The zoom cluster is the first control drawn that way ([the
canvas](../canvas/README.md)), and the toolbox (#175) is next. The burger
menu is not: its button is a glyph, but every command inside it is worded and
draws its chord beside the label.

## Who holds the keyboard

`binding.tsx` installs every chord once, on the document rather than on the
control that holds focus, which is what makes a command reachable from
wherever a person is. Three rules decide whether a press is the studio's:

- **A press a control has already acted on is not.** It arrives with its
  default prevented, which is how one Delete removes one element while the
  canvas still binds that key itself (`../canvas/diagram-canvas.tsx`).
  Consolidating the two into this one is a follow-up of its own, left out
  here because #154 owned that file while this was written.
- **A press an open overlay owns is not.** A listbox or a menu is handling
  the same keys, Escape and every letter of its typeahead among them, so
  nothing is taken out from under it.
- **A press typed into a control that takes characters is not**, unless the
  command is exempt: a text field, and a listbox trigger that is closed,
  whose typeahead is the same thing. Saving, saving as, undo and redo are the
  exemptions, so naming an element never deletes one, a save mid-sentence
  still saves, and no control leaves them dead under a person's hands.
  Escape is not among them, and it is the threat panel that takes it from
  inside a field: the panel claims the press, closes and hands focus back to
  the element. The second Escape runs Select and clears the selection ([the
  panel](../panel/README.md)). A
  refused draft outlives both, the panel holding it per element, so neither
  press is the one that destroys what was typed.

A press that is the studio's is claimed from the browser, whether or not the
command has a dispatch yet: a chord the studio advertises must not do
something else instead. A command that says when it is available is the
studio's only then: the diagram steps claim PageUp and PageDown while the
model holds more than one diagram, and leave them to scroll whatever has
focus in a model of one.

## The shortcut reference

The registry includes clipboard reuse, geometry, reconnection, flow
direction, arrangement, snapping, zoom reset, and fit selection. Their
shortcuts appear in the reference. Copy, Cut, Paste, Reset zoom, Duplicate,
Position and size, Change flow source, Change flow target, Toggle
bidirectional flow, Focus threats, and Delete selection are absent from the
burger menu. Their shortcuts remain available.
All keep text-field key ownership.

The Keyboard shortcuts item in the Help menu opens a non-modal reference
panel. Question mark and F1 toggle it when focus is outside a text field or
open menu. The panel overlays the left edge on a wide screen and the lower 60
percent on a narrow screen.

The panel starts with collapsed category cards. Each card shows its name and
entry count. Enter or Space expands it, and arrow keys move between category
headers. Multiple categories can stay open.

Alternative shortcuts appear on separate lines. Complete direction groups
read as `Arrow Keys` or `Shift+Arrow`. Groups that accept only some directions
list those keys individually. The shortcut column leaves room for the action
label, and its context spans the full row below.

The panel renders every command from `registry.ts`. It renders canvas keys
from `contextual-shortcuts.ts`, which also supplies the matchers and accessible
descriptions used where those keys act. Resize keys and distances come from
the canvas package, where the resize controls use them.

Opening the panel focuses its heading without trapping focus. Escape closes
it only while focus is inside and returns focus to the opener. The Close
button follows the same path.

## What a later slice does

Add bend (`+`) acts on one selected flow. It highlights a segment for
Left/Right selection, then Enter starts a bend. Arrow keys position the
preview, Enter commits, and Escape cancels. Existing focused bend handles
accept arrows and Delete/Backspace. These local keys belong to the bend
control, as resize keys belong to resize controls. `+` accepts either Shift
state because keyboard layouts differ in how they produce that character.
Ctrl or Command keeps its separate zoom binding. Text fields retain `+`.

- Flip a `pending` entry to `runs` when the issue lands its surface. A pending
  command keeps its chord reserved until then.
- Render a command through `CommandButton`, or `IconCommandButton` where the
  control is a glyph, or read `commandById` for a surface that draws its own
  control. Never hold a label or a chord beside a control: the menu, the
  toolbox, the panel and the zoom cluster read both from here. The menu is the
  worked example of the last route
  ([`../files/menu.tsx`](../files/menu.tsx)): a menu item draws the chord
  beside the label, where a native menu draws it, and hides it from assistive
  technology, which reads the binding off `aria-keyshortcuts` instead.
- Bind a new command by adding an entry, not by adding a listener. The spec
  beside the registry fails a chord that collides with one already bound.
- Add a contextual key to `contextual-shortcuts.ts`. Renderers, event handlers,
  and accessible descriptions read it from there.
- The tool commands select a mode. The toolbox reads those same entries for
  its icons, accessible names and tooltips. Space is Hand's momentary chord:
  the binding restores the prior tool on keyup, which a click has no keyup to
  answer.
