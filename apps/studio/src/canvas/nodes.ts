 * The nodes and the flows come back together because one pass over the layout
 * names both. A node a flow cannot end on is not connectable, so React Flow
 * refuses the gesture where it starts rather than letting it settle into an
 * edit the store would drop. `layout` must be laid out from `model`, as
 * {@link accessibleNames} requires.
 *
 * Every node and every edge object is built afresh here, so a selection
 * rebuilds them all and React Flow re-renders each one. That is one pass
 * over a diagram's elements with nothing measured, which is what lets the
 * canvas hold no view of the model of its own.
