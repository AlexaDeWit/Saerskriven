# The studio's model store

One store holds the whole studio: the model, history, transient view state,
file lifecycle, last refusal, and recovery status. Outside a spec reset,
`dispatch(action)` is the only way the state moves. It applies one pure
`reduce(state, action)`. Views read through selectors.

Zustand hosts it because it is the programming model React Flow 12 is built
on, so the canvas and the studio subscribe the same way and a component
re-renders only when the slice its selector returns changes. The runtime is
not shared: React Flow carries a zustand 4 copy of its own for its internal
store, which is its business and no version this workspace uses. The reducer
shape is the constraint the host had to satisfy, not something it provides.
Redux Toolkit is the same shape with more ceremony and Immer over operations
that are already pure, XState Store dispatches to per-event handlers rather
than one reducer and has a younger API, `useReducer` with context re-renders
every consumer on every dispatch, and jotai and valtio offer no reducer shape
and no immutable snapshot to push onto a stack.

## The shape

- `state.ts` holds `State`, the `FileLifecycle` and `StudioFailure` enums, the
  state a model starts in, and the placeholder model the studio opens on until
  a file is opened. The stacks hold whole models: the model's operations return
  new models sharing everything they did not change, so a snapshot is cheap.
  The placeholder is the smallest thing that is still a data-flow diagram, an
  actor, the records it sends, and the store they land in, and each box is a
  two-to-one box on the studio's grid, chosen for proportion, with room inside
  for its name at the canvas type size and a height of one line plus padding
  rounded up to the grid, so no name wraps and the flow's name has somewhere
  to hang clear of both. Its title is `Untitled`, which is what a model that
  has never been in a file is called, so the tab, the file controls and a
  saved file all read one string rather than a word a view supplied.
- `actions.ts` is the `Action` union, an Effect `Data.taggedEnum`. Model edits
  carry one operation and its arguments. `SetElementProperties` applies a typed
  patch to the existing element kind, including explicit clearing of optional
  fields. Invalid changes preserve the model and history. The mitigation and
  assumption actions (add, replace, link, unlink, set status) each carry one
  model operation, so an unlink that removes a record from its last threat
  is one undo step. `MoveElements` and `RemoveElements`
  fold the matching operation over one ID array before history records the
  result. `AddDiagram` appends a diagram and shows it, the one edit that
  moves the view as well as the model, since a diagram is added to be drawn
  on. The other tags cover history, the diagram on screen, selection, inline
  editing, files and failures. `DismissFailure` puts `lastFailure` away and
  touches nothing else, so a person can clear a refusal without the stacks,
  the saved point or the file moving. `Saved` names a file as `Opened` does,
  because a first save is a save-as, and folding both into `file` keeps
  "this model lives in this file" one fact. `Closed` is the third: the
  studio goes back to the state it booted in, placeholder model and all, so
  nothing of the file that was open survives for a later save to merge onto.
- `reducer.ts` is the one pure function, beside the private helpers its arms
  share. It is total: an operation the model refuses leaves the present and
  both stacks alone and records the refusal in `lastFailure`, so no dispatch
  fails and no view handles an error. A successful edit pushes the old present
  onto `past` and clears `future`.
- `store.ts` creates the vanilla store, `dispatch` applies the reducer to
  it, writes recoverable changes, publishes the state, and sends the result
  to the other tabs ([Other tabs](#other-tabs)). `useModelStore(selector)`
  is the React half. The store opens from recovery, the development model,
  or the placeholder, in that order. `onCanvasOrPanelChange(changed)`
  subscribes to the model on screen, the selection and the open inline
  field, which is the lifetime of a transient status: it ends at the next
  action that moves one of the three, never on a clock.
- `selectors.ts` derives what views show. Unsaved work is `present !== saved`
  by identity, so undoing back to the saved point clears it with no
  bookkeeping. `windowTitle` is what the browser tab is named: the model's
  name as the file session's `nameOf` gives it, ahead of the product name, so
  the tab and the menu cannot disagree on what the model is called.
  `showingPlaceholder` identifies that opening state for the document title.

The active diagram, selection, the inline editor, the last refusal, and the
file lifecycle stay out of the undo stacks. `activeDiagram` names the
diagram on screen, and nothing until one has been chosen, the first the
model holds being on screen meanwhile. `SelectDiagram` sets it, clears the
selection and closes the editor, since both belong to the diagram left, and
moves neither the model nor the history. The `activeDiagram` selector
resolves it, falling back to the first diagram while the model does not hold
the one named, so an open, an undo or a redo that takes the diagram away
leaves the canvas on something rather than refusing. `selection` is a
unique, ordered array of element IDs. A removal drops every removed ID from
it and closes a matching editor. `inlineEditor` names the element and
whether the field edits its name or its Note text. It is in the store
because a command reaches it from the keyboard
([the canvas](../canvas/README.md)). Being total, the reducer cannot refuse
`Opened` or `Closed` over unsaved work, so the guards on those, and the one
on closing the tab, belong in the view
([the file bridge](../files/README.md)).

`FileLifecycle.Opened` carries the file's name and its `RetainedSource`: the
format it was read as, and the wire document that read produced. The document
is there because a save merges the model onto it, and what Saerskriven does not
model survives only that way. It rides in the store rather than in a component
so that one dispatch settles which file the model lives in and what a save
merges onto, and it stays out of the stacks with the rest of the file: an undo
moves the model, never the file. The type is derived from the formats
package's detected-read union, so a document cannot be filed under the wrong
format and nothing has to assert which codec owns which.

## Recovery

`recovery-storage.ts` owns loading, replacing, and clearing one snapshot. The
browser adapter uses `saerskriven:studio:recovery` in `localStorage`.
Version 2 stores the model as a Saerskriven YAML wire document, with dirty
status, the file lifecycle, the studio version that wrote it, and the active
diagram as an optional field, so a snapshot written before that field existed
still loads. The file lifecycle includes the name, format, and retained wire
document. A restored active diagram the model no longer holds is dropped.

The model travels as a version 1 document of
[the native format](../../../../docs/saerskriven-yaml.md), so the snapshot
inherits that format's compatibility contract: a session survives every
upgrade a file in that format survives. A field added to the model costs the
snapshot nothing, because the format declares the new key as optional within
version 1 and the read maps a document written without it onto the model the
current release requires. A breaking format change will ship as a new wire
package with a step in `formats`, and the snapshot will follow that step
rather than carry one of its own. No such step exists yet, so until one does,
a document of a version this release does not know is rejected like any
malformed snapshot. The studio version in `writtenBy` is information for a
refusal, never a guard on what loads.

Going through the format costs the order of the threat register: the format
writes threats in number order, so a restore puts them in number order, as an
open of the saved file does.

Version 1 of the snapshot held the model itself rather than a document, and
nothing maps it. It is refused with a reason saying an earlier release wrote
it, distinct from the reason a malformed or unsupported snapshot gets, and the
placeholder opens.

`dispatch` writes each changed recoverable field before it publishes the new
state. The reducer performs no storage work. The snapshot excludes the undo
and redo stacks, selection, rename state, and the last failure. A restored
session starts with those fields empty.

Startup bounds and parses the stored text before its schema validates the
version, document, file data, and retained source. Missing data opens the
placeholder without a report. Rejected data opens the placeholder and records
`StoredRecoveryRejected`.

A successful write marks the current state as recoverable. A failed write
records `RecoveryUnavailable` and leaves that mark false. The page guard uses
that mark with dirty status. A later recoverable change retries the write.
Close clears the snapshot. A failed clear keeps the session open for retry.

The snapshot never holds a browser file handle. A restored file keeps its name,
format, and retained source. Its next Save uses a new bridge with no handle.

### Other tabs

Every studio tab in one browser profile shows the same result, so a person
edits in whichever tab is in front of them. `sync.ts` carries it over a
`BroadcastChannel`, which the browser delivers to every other tab of the
origin and never back to the sender: `dispatch` publishes the result of each
change that moved the model, a stack, the saved point or the file, and the
other tabs fold it into `Followed`. The result is the model, both stacks, the
saved point, the file and whether the recovery storage holds it, sent by
structured clone, which keeps the references the stacks and the identity-based
dirty check share. Selection, an open field and the diagram on screen stay
with the tab that made them, the first two trimmed to the elements the adopted
model still draws and the last falling back to the first diagram where the
adopted model lacks it. A diagram switch writes the shared snapshot, so a
reload restores the diagram whichever tab switched last, but publishes no
result. Following writes nothing and publishes nothing, since the result is
already the other tab's.
The file session is what watches ([the file bridge](../files/README.md)),
because a model another tab wrote is one the handle it holds does not
describe.

A message is trusted on its build alone: it comes from this origin's own
code, and the envelope carries the commit CI built the bundle from
(`studioBuildId`), so a tab left open across a deploy and a tab on the new
code ignore each other rather than exchange state neither describes. That is
what lets a message carry the model as the running code holds it, with no
format in between: two tabs share a build exactly when they run the same code.
State that outlives a build travels in the recovery snapshot instead, which is
why the snapshot holds a document and the channel does not. Two
tabs editing at once each adopt the other's result, so they diverge until
the next change in either, while the recovery storage holds whichever wrote
last. A tab opened later starts from the recovery snapshot, without history,
and catches up at the next change in any tab. A followed result with empty
stacks, another tab's open or close, fits the follower's viewport as an open
here would.

## Rules for changes

`InsertFragment` inserts copied elements and related records as one edit.
`ArrangeElements` applies separate node offsets atomically.
`ReconnectFlow` replaces one endpoint through the model operation.
An unchanged selection retains its array identity, so repeated canvas
callbacks do not erase the announcement for the completed selection change.

- A reducer arm changes the model only by calling a `@saerskriven/model`
  operation and folding its `Either`. Never assign into `state.present` or
  into anything it holds: the stacks share those objects, so one write in
  place rewrites every snapshot at once and takes undo, redo and unsaved work
  down together. The spec that holds this clones the state with
  `structuredClone`, so `State` holds plain data: no function, class instance
  or ref goes in it. The state it clones has a file open, carrying the wire
  document a read retained, because a guard only covers what the clone is
  handed.
- A new mutation is a new action tag, a reducer arm, and a spec. Never a store
  method that edits the state beside the reducer, and never a copy of model
  state held in a component.
- A new kind of refusal is a `StudioFailure` member, not a second field beside
  `lastFailure`, so a view renders one value however the refusal arose.
- `reduce` folds the action with Effect's `$match`, whose cases object is typed
  by the union, so a tag with no arm beside it does not compile and an arm for
  a tag the union does not declare does not either. Keep it that way.
- The spec tables are typed over every model tag too, so a new operation cannot
  land without its happy-path case, its refusal, its undo round-trip and its
  purity case.
- Views read by selector. A selector that builds a fresh array or object needs
  zustand's `useShallow` at the call site, or the component re-renders on every
  dispatch.
- A high-frequency gesture reaches the store once, at its end. React Flow keeps
  positions during a drag. A drop dispatches one `MoveElement` or one
  `MoveElements` for the full selection.
