 * (`mitigated`), move it to someone else such as an insurer or a supplier
 * (`transferred`), remove the feature or path that creates it (`avoided`),
 * or carry it knowingly (`accepted-risk`). `eliminated` is the threat a
 * change has made impossible rather than merely unlikely, which is a
 * stronger claim than mitigation and worth recording as one.
 * `not-applicable` is the threat that never applied to this system, which
 * is a judgement about the analysis rather than about the risk.
