 *
 * A column is one grapheme cluster, so a break falls between clusters: a
 * regional-indicator flag stays one flag, a family joined by zero-width
 * joiners stays one family, and half a surrogate pair never lands on a line
 * of its own.
 *
 * A cluster is settled by an explicit rule over code points rather than by
 * `Intl.Segmenter`, whose segmentation data moves with the runtime's ICU and
 * would move a golden on a Node bump. A code point joins the one before it
 * where it is a combining mark, a variation selector among them, an emoji
 * skin tone modifier, or a tag character, which is what spells out a
 * subdivision flag such as Scotland. A zero-width joiner takes what follows
 * it into the same cluster, and a pair of regional indicators is one cluster,
 * on its own or after a joiner. What the rule reads is general category and
 * the regional indicator property, not a segmentation table.
 *
 * What it does not cover, and so still breaks, is a Hangul jamo sequence, a
 * prepended concatenation mark such as U+0600, an Indic conjunct joined
 * through a virama, and the Thai and Lao vowel signs U+0E33 and U+0EB3, which
 * UAX #29 holds to their base but which carry no mark category.
