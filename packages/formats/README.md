# @saerskriven/formats

The codec contract for Saerskriven's file formats. `Codec` is one interface over
two paths. `read` returns the internal model together with the wire document
it was mapped from. `write` takes that document back as an option: given one
it merges onto it, so what the model does not describe stays as the file had
it; given none it projects the model into the format's canonical form.

A format is adopted completely or not at all. Its wire schema declares
everything the format carries, the parts Saerskriven does not model included,
because that completeness is what preserves them: a merge leaves untouched
what it does not map, and only a declared key is there to leave alone. The
schema is demanding about what it declares and drops what it does not, so
`read` returns divergences of its own naming the keys it stripped, and an
incomplete schema announces itself rather than quietly shortening the file.

The interface is generic over that schema and carries it as a member, so the
contract cannot describe a codec without one, and `write` accepts only a
document its own schema describes.

A divergence is any place a file and the model do not correspond exactly, or
a written file and the source it was merged onto, and one list of them serves
every path. Each entry names the entity, what did not correspond, and why:
`unrepresentable` for what the format cannot express, `undeclared` for a key a
read dropped, `narrowed` for a value reduced to fit, `split` for one record
the format forces into several, `overridden` for a value the codec wrote over
rather than repeated, and `discarded-by-edit` for what an edit removed from
the file. An empty list is the aligned case, and `renderDivergences` turns the
list into lines for a person, escaping what an imported id could otherwise do
to a line. `escapedForTerminal` is that escaping less the quote an id in
quotes takes on top of it, exported because the CLI writes model text to a
terminal on paths of its own and one escaper is what keeps the two from
drifting apart.

`read` returns Effect's `Either` with a package-owned `ReadFailure` on the
error channel, one variant per place a read stops: a text past a read limit,
text the format's syntax refuses, a document the wire schema refuses, and a
mapping `parseModel` refuses. The two schema variants carry the model
package's `ParseIssue`, so issues read the same way whichever boundary
produced them, and `readFailureIssues` folds any failure to the issues it
carries. Nothing throws. Imports `@saerskriven/model` and the wire packages,
and no other internal package.

`readLimits` is what a read may spend on a text before it refuses it. It is
one exported value, so a caller that checks a file before handing it over
enforces the numbers the codecs enforce rather than numbers of its own. Four
parsing bounds today, each with headroom over the largest file the repository vendors
and each justified by a fixture under `test-data/adversarial` built to break
it: the size of the text in UTF-8 bytes, 8 MiB and about sixty times that
file (4 MiB up to 0.3.0, so an earlier release refuses a file between the
two); how far below the root a value may sit, 64 levels; how many aliases
resolving a document works through, 50; and how much of a document those
aliases reach, 100,000 nodes.

Both reads pass their text through `parseWithinLimits`. The size is measured
before a parser sees the text, since that bound is what keeps the parse itself
finite, and the nesting of what it parsed to is measured after, by a walk
carrying its own stack that stops one level past the bound. The walk bounds
its own work as well as its depth: it goes level by level and expands a node
only when it reaches that node deeper than it has before, so a value reachable
along many paths costs its own size rather than the number of paths through
it, and it holds every distinct node it has expanded while it runs, so a
document costs about its own parsed size again. A cycle an alias closed is
unbounded depth, which the walk climbs to the bound and refuses there rather
than following, and one that branches costs its width rather than multiplying
by it at every level.

The YAML read takes both alias bounds between composing a document and
resolving it, which is the only place the cheap measurement exists, and it
takes them itself: `toJS` is called with `maxAliasCount: -1`, so the parser
accounts for nothing. Its accounting resolves an alias by scanning the whole
document and takes that scan once per anchor, so a document nesting anchors
within anchors pays it once per level: fifty aliases arranged that way in a
4 MiB text cost 147 seconds inside the parser, where measuring them here costs
a fifth of a millisecond. A nesting the parser has no stack for is still
reported as the bound that stopped the read.

One traversal of the composed document takes both numbers. How many aliases
resolution works through is one for each alias plus the expanded aliases
inside its anchor, weighed bottom up, so a cycle is an anchor reached from
inside itself and is refused there rather than by the nesting walk further on.
How much of the document those aliases reach is the nodes under each alias's
anchor summed over the aliases, because a count says nothing about size: a
one-node anchor is as cheap to alias as a two-million-node one. What an alias
costs there is not a copy, since `toJS` hands every alias to one anchor the
same value: it is that the nesting walk expands a node again for each depth an
alias reaches it from. The traversal costs the document, once, and the
counting after it costs the ceilings: a node is counted once under an anchor,
an anchor is walked once however many aliases repeat it, and neither walk
holds more than one node's children past what it can still count.

`JSON.parse` needs no such handling, since it builds a value of any depth
without recursing, which leaves the walk as the only thing standing between a
3,000-deep payload and whatever would have recursed over it. A text within the
bounds reads exactly as it did before they existed.

`readThreatDragon` is the Threat Dragon v2 read. The format is declared by
[`@saerskriven/wire-threat-dragon`](../wire-threat-dragon/README.md), which
imports zod and nothing else, and this package is the only one that maps
between it and the model. That wire schema declares the whole file, the X6
styling and port styling that Saerskriven does not model included. What it declares it demands, and it demands nothing else, because it
describes the file rather than the subset Saerskriven can represent: a threat's
status, severity, category and methodology are text, since Threat Dragon
stores each label in the author's own locale, and a threat number is optional,
since most threats in Threat Dragon's own demo models carry none. `version`
accepts `2`, `2.x` and `2.x.y`, and a file from another major is refused whole
rather than read in part. A cell id and a threat id are two characters or
more, the bound Threat Dragon's own schema states, so a file that breaks it
stops as `InvalidWireDocument` with a path into the file rather than as
`InvalidModel` one layer later. A key the schema does not declare is dropped
and reported through `undeclaredDivergences`, the walk every wire codec
shares, so a schema that has fallen behind the format announces itself.

Element security facts and declared boundary relationships map into typed model
properties and native YAML v1. The mappings preserve explicit negatives, empty
values, and absence. Threat Dragon writes include these facts without needing the
original JSON. With a source document, mapped facts follow the model while styling
and other unmapped fields retain the source values. A removed optional model fact
also disappears from the merged source. Invalid security text returns an
`InvalidModel` failure with the field path. Invalid relationship targets do too,
including missing, cross-diagram and wrong-kind references. Neither read silently
removes a recorded assertion to make an invalid source pass.

A value with no home in the internal model therefore reaches the document
intact, and what the mapping then does with it is a separate question from
how the file is read. A category label is looked up in the language Threat
Dragon wrote it in before it is read, so a German file and an English one
describing the same threat reach the same category. A methodology the model
does not enumerate becomes a custom category carrying Threat Dragon's own
names unchanged, which is the model's escape hatch working rather than a
loss, so nothing is reported for it. Two things are reported, because the
model does hold them less exactly than the file stated them: an Elevation of
Privilege card, of which only the suit has a home, and a label from a
language Threat Dragon has added since this codec read its translations. A
threat the file leaves unnumbered is issued the next number above the model's
own mark.

Two corpora under `test-data/threat-dragon` gate this, each a different part
of it. The twelve threat models Threat Dragon ships in its own v2 format all
read, with no key undeclared and no value narrowed, which is the gate on the
wire schema being complete. The label tables it ships in sixteen languages
are the gate on the recovery above, which those models cannot exercise: every
one of them is written in English.

`readSaerskrivenYaml` and `writeSaerskrivenYaml` are the Saerskriven YAML format,
version 1, paired as `saerskrivenYamlCodec`. It is the native format. A write
leaves out only an assumption's model link, which version 1 has no key for,
and reports each assumption that applies to the model as `narrowed`. It
states `mitigation: ""` on every threat, since a mitigation is a record. A
read sets no model link, and maps away assumption element links, which the
model no longer holds: `withoutAssumptionElementLinks` empties them and
`droppedAssumptionElementLinks` reports each assumption that held any as
`narrowed`. A read also turns each threat's `mitigation` text into a record
through `withMitigationTextAsRecords`, on the terms of the Threat Dragon read
below, with every id the file holds taken, and reports nothing, since nothing
is lost. Both steps are functions over the version 1 document, and the
document a read hands back has been through them.
[`docs/saerskriven-yaml.md`](../../docs/saerskriven-yaml.md) describes the
file itself.

The format is declared by [`@saerskriven/wire-saerskriven-yaml`](../wire-saerskriven-yaml/README.md),
which imports zod and nothing else. A file is a contract with people who
already have one and the model is ours to change, so the two are separate
declarations that happen to say the same thing today, and this package is the
only one that knows both. The mapping is written out record by record in both
directions, and every vocabulary crosses through the tables in
`saerskriven-yaml-vocabulary.ts`, each annotated with the whole `Record` of the
side it reads: a member added to either vocabulary is a compile error in the
mapping. Ids cross as the plain strings a file holds and are branded by
`parseModel`, the same way the Threat Dragon read hands them over.

`formatVersion` is a zod literal, so a file stamped with anything else fails
at that path rather than reaching the mapping, which is what will let the
detection layer tell a Saerskriven file from a JSON one without the extension.
Within version 1 a key the schema does not declare is dropped and reported
through `undeclaredDivergences`, the same walk the Threat Dragon read uses,
so a file from a later release still reads.

Two writes of one model are byte-identical, which is what makes a model file
in git worth diffing. `canonicalOrder` puts each object's keys in the order
its schema declares them, with the tag of a tagged union first; threats are
written in number order, a number being unique and never reissued; and no
line is wrapped, so an edited sentence changes its own line rather than
reflowing the paragraph. Every other list keeps the model's order. `write`
takes the contract's source document and cannot be changed by it: there is
nothing for a merge to preserve when the format holds the whole model.

Two files in this format are committed and compared byte for byte on every
run, so a change to what the format writes arrives as a diff on a file.
`test-data/saerskriven/ecluse.yaml` is the Écluse model, read from Threat Dragon
and written here. [`threat-modelling/saerskriven.yaml`](../../threat-modelling/README.md)
is Saerskriven's own threat model, authored in this format rather than read out
of another, and it is its own golden: the read of the committed bytes is
written back and compared against the file itself. `nativeFixtures` is the
list of them, and the reads, the detection and the read-limit gates all
iterate it, so a third file joins all of them by being added there. Each
entry also names where its internal model is written out for the packages
that cannot import a codec, or names none where another package is that
file's producer. `test-data/saerskriven.model.json` is the one this suite writes
out, read by `packages/canvas` and `packages/render`, while `apps/cli` reads
both committed files above and `apps/studio` the Saerskriven one, so all four of
those suites run after this one:
[`test-data/README.md`](../../test-data/README.md) names
the pairs and [`CODING.md`](../../CODING.md) the rule that orders them.
Models generated over the model's own shape gate the rest: each survives a
write and a read as itself, with its threats in number order.

`writeThreatDragon` is the other half, and the two are paired as
`threatDragonCodec`. Given the document a read returned it merges the model
onto it, and given none it projects the model into Threat Dragon's own
canonical form. Output is built through the wire schema's
inferred types, so the writer cannot emit a shape that schema would refuse,
and the path down to a threat, which Threat Dragon nests eight levels deep at
`detail.diagrams[i].cells[j].data.threats[k]`, is walked with the typed
helpers in `threat-dragon-document.ts` rather than with casts.

The merge writes over the mapped fields and leaves the document otherwise as
it found it, which is how `attrs` styling, `zIndex` and `tools` survive a save. A port is half
mapped: Threat Dragon fastens a flow end to a port, and a port belongs to one
of four groups named for the sides of the cell, so the read takes the port's
side as the end's pinned side and the write fastens a pinned end to a port on
that side, the source's own where it already sits there, else one the cell
declares there, else one the write declares on the cell and names for the
side. An end the model leaves to the renderer is written with no port, since
a port would read back as a pinned side. `isBidirectional` maps to the flow's
`bidirectional` both ways. A mapped field is
rewritten only where what the source says no longer reads back as what the
model says, because the mapping is not injective in two places the corpus
holds: Threat Dragon stores a category as the label its author saw, so a
German file says `Manipulation` where an English one says `Tampering`, and it
reads both `TBD` and `TBA` as the one undecided severity. Overwriting either
would record a user's edit where the read merely normalized.

Three decisions the codec makes on its own, each reported as `overridden`
where the source said otherwise. It stamps the release it models, 2.6.2,
rather than repeating the one the file arrived with. It raises
`detail.threatTop` to cover a number it wrote that the file did not already
carry, so Threat Dragon issues no number twice, and never lowers it: the mark
is what keeps the gap a removed threat left from being handed out again. The
mark rises for one other reason, and says which: a model that has issued
above every number the file holds would otherwise lose that gap on the way
back in. A file that declared no mark at all is given one covering the
numbers it holds, since a zero there is a number Threat Dragon would reissue.
`detail.diagramTop` follows the same rules for a diagram number. Issuing a
number is not itself a divergence, since the file gains a fact rather than
losing one.

What the format cannot hold is named rather than dropped in silence: an
assumption, which Threat Dragon keeps no record of; a threat
attached to a trust boundary or a note, which it nests threats under neither;
a note's name, which it holds one text for; an out-of-scope marking on a
boundary or a note; and a diagram's name, which the format replaces with a
number. A value that does reach the file and comes back holding less is
narrowed rather than unrepresentable, which is where a PLOT4ai category
lands: the label is written whole, and reads back as a custom category
because Threat Dragon ships an older eight-category set naming something
else. A threat this write is the one to divide across several cells is
reported as `split`, and a document that already nested it under each of them
was split before this write ran, so a merge onto it reports nothing. Where a
merge meets a document an edit has moved out from under, the diagram, cell,
or threat that went is reported as `discarded-by-edit` with what it was
carrying.

Threat Dragon holds one mitigation text per threat, and the model holds
mitigations as records. The read makes one record of a non-empty text, linked
to that threat alone, with an empty title, the text as its prose, and the
status `implemented` where the threat is `mitigated` and `proposed` otherwise.
A status is inferred only across a one-to-one correspondence like this one. The
record's id is `<threat id>-mitigation`, counted on with `-2`, `-3` past any
id the model already holds, as `mitigationsFromText` in `mitigation-text.ts`
states. The records follow threat number order, so this read and the
Saerskriven YAML version 1 read make the same records in the same order of
one model. The write flattens the mitigations linked to a threat, in register
order, into its one text: a record's title on a line above its prose, a blank
line between records. A text merging more than one record, or carrying a record's
title, reads back as one record with no title, so it is reported once per
threat as `narrowed`. A record with neither title nor prose writes nothing and
is `unrepresentable` once per threat it would be written into. A record written into several threats' texts is
`split`, and one written into none is `unrepresentable`. The
format has no place for a record's status, and the write adds no text or key
for one, so a mitigation whose status differs from what a read of a threat it
is written into infers is reported as `unrepresentable` once for each such
threat. An unedited read written back keeps every text to the byte and reports
none of these.

Three oracles gate the write, all of them over the vendored corpus rather
than over invented input. Every file is written straight back onto its own
document and compared raw parsed input against raw parsed output: no scalar
moves but the stamps above, and each one that moves is matched by the
divergence that claims it. On `ecluse.json`, which is already stamped 2.6.2
and already numbers every threat, nothing moves at all and nothing is
reported. Every file then reads back as the model it was written from, and
`ecluse.json` reads back as the internal model committed at
`test-data/ecluse.model.json`, which `packages/model` holds against its own
fixture and writes on an update run, ordered ahead of this suite as
[`CODING.md`](../../CODING.md) states. And every written file validates
against the JSON Schema Threat Dragon ships, run through ajv as that tool
runs it. That schema describes the file Threat Dragon writes only in part,
and threats least of all: it declares them beside `data` rather than under
it, and constrains nothing this codec puts there. So the oracle gates the
shape of the document, and the two oracles above are what gate its threats.

`readAnyFormat` opens a text without being told which format it is, and
answers with the codec that read it beside everything that read produced. The
CLI, Studio and the MCP load tool will each open files, so the choice is made
here once rather than three times.

Detection is the reads themselves: the registered codecs are tried in order,
and each is tried by reading. A codec claims a text when its read succeeds,
when the mapping fails, or when its wire schema refuses the document over
something other than the root keys that name the format, which `detect.ts`
lists beside each codec. It does not claim when the text is not the format's
syntax at all, when the schema's complaint is at one of those naming keys or
above them, or when the complaint is about the document as a whole, a text
that is no mapping at all being no format's file.

A document that has lost a whole naming key at the root is therefore claimed
by nobody, where the same document broken one level under a naming key is
claimed and then refused. That is where the line falls: a version-stamped JSON
file carrying no summary section at all is likelier a file of another tool
than a Threat Dragon file that lost one, and a file holding a cell the schema
refuses is a broken file of a known format rather than a file of some other.
Once a codec claims, its answer stands: a claimed file that then fails comes
back as that codec's own `ReadFailure`, where it broke, rather than falling
through to the next codec.

A read bound stops detection outright, ahead of any question of claiming: what
a text costs to read is a property of the text rather than of a format, so an
`ExceededReadLimit` is the answer and no further codec is offered the text.

Threat Dragon is tried first, and the order is a cost decision rather than a
correctness one. JSON is YAML, so trying Saerskriven YAML first would run the
YAML parser over the whole of every Threat Dragon file before the schema
refused it at `formatVersion`, where trying Threat Dragon first stops on a
YAML file at the first character JSON cannot begin with. A file name is never
consulted in either direction, so a Saerskriven model saved as `.json` opens as a
Saerskriven model.

Where no codec claims, the failure is `NoFormatClaimed`, which names every
format tried, in the order tried, and carries no codec's issues: a codec that
did not claim was refusing a format the text was never in, and its complaints
describe a document nobody wrote. A file from a release neither codec models
lands there, a `formatVersion` other than 1 and a Threat Dragon version
outside major 2 among them, so a later release of either format needs a codec
of its own rather than a looser reader, and until there is one the person
holding the file is told what was tried.

The result is a union with one member per codec, discriminated by `format`, so
narrowing on the name pairs a source document with the codec that produced it:
`codec.write(model, source)` type-checks inside a member, and pairing one
member's source with the other member's codec does not compile. Which document
belongs to which codec is what a caller cannot check by looking at the
document, which is why the codec comes back and not the model alone.

[Import](IMPORT.md) is a separate conversion path for OTM and TM-BOM. It
produces native models without adding those formats to Open or Save As.

Nothing here parses a text of its own. Detection is the codec reads, so the
bounds those reads put on size, nesting and aliases bound a detected read
too.
