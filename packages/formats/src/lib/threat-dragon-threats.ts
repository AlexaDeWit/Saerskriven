 * threat left. Both can happen in one write. What is exclusive is which one
 * sets the value: a number this write issues is written into the file and so
 * is reachable from it, which puts it below a mark that is not, so

/**
 * The model's threats as Threat Dragon nests them. Ours attach to any
 * number of elements and Threat Dragon nests each under one cell, so a
 * threat naming several is written under each of them, and one naming a
 * trust boundary, a note, or nothing at all is reported as unrepresentable,
 * since those are not cells a threat attaches to.
 *
 * `split` is reported for the record this write is the one to divide. A
 * source that already nests the threat under every cell the model names was
 * split before this write ran, and nothing became several here, so a merge
 * of an unedited model onto that document reports nothing.
 *
 * A threat the source already holds under a cell is merged onto that copy
 * and the cell's own order is kept, so a threat nobody touched leaves the
 * file exactly as it was. Its status, severity and category stay as the
 * source spelled them wherever that spelling still reads back as the model's
 * value, because Threat Dragon writes a category in its author's own
 * language and reads two spellings of the undecided severity. Its mitigation
 * text is built from the mitigations linked to it, on the terms of
 * {@link mitigationText}.
 *
 * The {@link HighWaterMark} the plan carries is floored on what the file
 * declared, since a mark the file already carries is its own claim, and on
 * what the file holds where it declared none, since a zero written onto a
 * file holding a threat numbered 4 would have Threat Dragon hand 1 to 4 out
 * again. Above that floor it covers every number this write put in the file
 * that the file did not already carry, and the model's own mark where the
 * file's numbers fall short of it.
