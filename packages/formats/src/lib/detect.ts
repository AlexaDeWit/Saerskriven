/**
 * A text as the model it holds, read by whichever registered codec claims
 * it, with that codec beside the result so a later write goes back through
 * the same one. A file name is never consulted: a Saerskriven model saved as
 * `.json` and a Threat Dragon model saved as nothing at all are both
 * ordinary, so the content decides.
 *
 * Detection is the reads themselves, in the order the registry lists them.
 * A codec claims a text when its read succeeds, when the mapping fails
 * (`InvalidModel`), or when its wire schema refuses the document over
 * something other than the root keys that name the format, which the
 * registry lists beside each codec. It does not claim when the text is not
 * the format's syntax at all (`MalformedText`), nor when the schema's
 * complaint is at one of those naming keys or above them, a text that is no
 * mapping at all being no format's file.
 *
 * A document that has lost a whole naming key is therefore claimed by
 * nobody, where the same document broken one level under a naming key is
 * claimed and refused: a Threat Dragon file whose `summary` has gone is
 * likelier a file of some other tool that stamps a version, and one whose
 * `summary.title` has gone is a broken file of this one. Once a codec
 * claims, its answer stands: a failure comes back as that codec's own
 * failure rather than falling through to the next codec, so a broken file
 * of a known format is reported where it broke.
 *
 * A read bound stops detection outright, ahead of any question of
 * claiming. What a text costs to read is a property of the text and not of
 * a format, so an `ExceededReadLimit` comes back as the answer and no
 * further codec is offered the text: the next codec would spend the same
 * cost to learn the same thing.
 *
 * The order is a cost decision and either order is correct. JSON is YAML,
 * so trying Saerskriven YAML first runs the YAML parser over every Threat
 * Dragon file before the schema refuses it at `formatVersion`, where trying
 * Threat Dragon first stops on a YAML file at the first character JSON
 * cannot begin with. Threat Dragon goes first.
 *
 * Where no codec claims, the failure is {@link DetectionFailure} naming
 * every format tried, in order, and carrying no codec's issues. A file
 * neither codec models lands there, a missing `formatVersion` or one other
 * than 1 and 2, and a Threat Dragon version outside major 2, among them. A
 * Saerskriven YAML file of either version is claimed, and one broken below
 * `formatVersion` is refused with a path. A later release of either format
 * needs a reader of its own rather than a looser one.
