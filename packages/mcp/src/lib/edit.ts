The first edit the model refuses stops the batch: nothing is written, the file stays byte for byte as it was, and the result names the index that was refused and what the model said about it. The batch is the unit of change rather than the edit.',

  `Each edit is an object carrying \`op\` and that op's own fields. The ops are ${editOps.join(', ')}.`,
  '`add_element` accepts the optional security facts and declared relationships of its element kind. `set_element_properties` takes the element id and a `properties` object with `kind` and the fields to change. Omitted fields stay unchanged. Its optional `unset` list names fields to clear back to not recorded. False, empty text and empty lists are recorded values. A field cannot be set and unset in the same edit.',
  'Pass `revision` as the handle the last read of this file returned. A file that changed before this call is refused rather than overwritten, and the answer to that refusal is to read the file again and reconsider the edit against what the file now holds. The file is hashed again immediately before it is replaced, so a change that landed while this call was working is refused there instead of overwritten. That check is not a lock: a save landing between it and the replacement is still overwritten with neither side told, so read the file in the same turn you edit it, and expect to lose an edit where somebody is working in the same file from another tool.',

  "A mitigation's references are its threat links. An assumption's references are its threat links and its model link. An edit that takes a record's last reference away (removing the threat that was its last reference, unlinking it, unlinking an assumption from the model where it links no threat, or a replace that leaves it none) removes the record in the same edit. The result names under `culled`, once each, every record the file held before the batch that an edit of the batch culled, even where a later edit adds it back. A record removed by `remove_mitigation` or `remove_assumption` is not named there, and neither is one the batch itself added.",
  'A threat carries no number: the model issues one when a threat is added and holds it when the threat is replaced, so numbers name one threat for the life of a model and there is no edit that renumbers.',
  'Use this on a model that exists. Start a new one with saer_create and convert a foreign file with saer_import. What the file format cannot hold comes back in the divergences of the result rather than as a refusal, so read them after a write to a Threat Dragon file.',
